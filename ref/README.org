* b4/ref

** this is a junk drawer :)

One of the ideas behind =b4= was to create a teaching tool, to accompany a series of lessons about programming.

Over the years, the =b4= repo accumulated a bunch of notes and experiments related to that idea,
and many of them are still in this directory.

None of this is really tied to the current b4 virtual machine, but I'm keeping it around for future use.


** some highlights:

- [[b4.rkt]] partial implementation of b4vm in racket.
- [[go/risc.pas]] is an niklaus wirth's risc machine from [[http://www.projectoberon.com/][project oberon]].
- [[go/ukanren.py]] is a port of [[https://github.com/jasonhemann/microKanren][microkanren]] to python
- [[go/logic.py]] seems to be some kind of proof assistant i don't remember writing. :)
