old notes about the memory allocator:


* heap structure
- 'new' and 'del' bios opcodes (predefined in the ^^ and ^_ slots)
  simple interface but we can plug in more or less sophisticated algorithms.
  
- heap header has multiple linked lists of sized blocks
- each block has a header (next, size, used)
  used is either the actual used size or 0 for free

* traversing the lists
- every block is part of at least one linked list.


* finding big enough block
- only look for blocks of size 2^n cells
- there's some max sized block (4k or whatever)
- first check the list for the block size we want.
- if list is empty, check next list and split

* split a block

* delete

* coalesce
