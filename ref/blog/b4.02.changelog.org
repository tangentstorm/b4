#+TITLE: b4 changelog

* [2/2] phase 1 : retro vm / debugger
** TODO fill in the early part of the changelog from git history
** DONE [2012-09-29 Sat] implement hex() correctly
Fixed, but then I decided not to use it.
** DONE [2012-09-29 Sat] set up xterm's 256 colors
Not exactly critical, but it made the debugger a bit more readable.
