** operations on state: simple calculator
- visual 'buttons' that do the work
- number buttons: multiply by base and add digit
- clear, inc, dec?

** sequence:
*** visual virtual machine
*** no-op, breakpoints
(so we can see the cursor moving)
*** place opcodes in the cells directly

** repetition:
- simple counter
- implement addition, multiplication

** conditionals
- show jumping over some code
- show 'else' using [a?] [b?] [c?] [d?]
- so consider this instead: [ c ? a | b ]
- now:
  [ c0 ? a | [ c1 ? b ] ]
- so just allow 'elif'

** idea create an assembler via stepwise refinement
*** TODO write an assembler in pascal-like psuedocode
*** TODO show how to translate that psuedocode to instructions
