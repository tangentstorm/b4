#+title: message passing

B4 machines exist in a swarm and can pass messages to each other.

Messages are strings broken into 64-byte chunks.
The first 63 bytes of a chunk contain the data (and possibly
padding or garbage bytes at the end).

The final byte describes the length of the chunk
(6 bits to indicate the numbers 0..63), 1 bit to
indicate whether more messages are coming, and 1 bit
that acts as a semaphore indicating whether the message
has been processed (and can therefore be overwritten).
