#+title: bootstrapping a forth-like assembler

* OUTPUT
This org-mode document, when run through =org-babel-tangle= in emacs, produces two output files, both of which are assemblers for the b3 assembly language, =b3a=.

=b3= is a stripped down version of the =b4= virtual machine, (in development at the time of this writing).
The b3 version provides only the opcodes necessary to run this assembler on itself.

** file:b3a.b3a is b3a assembler written in b3a.
#+begin_src b3a :tangle b3a.b3a :noweb yes

  This is a simplfied version of b3a.b3a.

  It does not provide the ability to create macros
  (since that would require a b3 bytecode interpreter).
  Instead, it has hard-coded support for the specific
  macros used in b3a.b3a.

* INTRO (why bother bootstrapping?)
- narrative so people (including me) can understand what's happening
- tool for others to follow along (and get exact same results)
- you don't have to already know forth or assembly to follow along.
- we're just going to make up whatever we need or what we want the bytecode to be
- it doesn't matter what the vm looks like, because in the end we'll have a forth, and we can use that to write a more advanced assembler.
- once you have your b4, you'll understand it completely, and you can make changes to tailor it to your own system.
- you can follow the trail and implement the virtual machine to learn your new language or chip or whatever, and then you can use my tools.
- (hopefully someday b4 itself will be able to guide you through implementing the b4 vm in a new environment, but these can still serve as test cases along the way)
- maybe people will understand my stuff and make it better or contribute tools
- just seems like fun. :)
- it's really hard to bootstrap and figure this out, which is why most people just use the completed tools, but then that shifts the burden to new people trying to understand the system. by leaving a trail, maybe it'll make a smoother onramp for someone trying to understand b4, or just to bootstrap their own system.

* GOALS

1. I want to bootstrap a small repl on a forthlike system.
It should be handy for symbolic processing of source code.

2. I want this to be something that's easy to follow and easy to present,
for other people wanting to work on their own forth implementations.

More importantly, I want some kindof *feedback* from the system at each step.
This is probably the main thing missing in most bootstrapping stories I've
encountered: you have to do lots of steps before you get any feedback from
the system.

So instead, let's focus on clearly defined checkpoints
that don't take much work to reach.

* PREPARATION
We should have templates for doing basic things:

** macros used:
#+begin_src b3a
.b # write byte (probably going to be a plain op)

# assembler macros that anyone can use

.i #if
.j #loop index
.n #next

.z #fi

# macros
^a invokes the assembler
^l stores length of the input buffer
^r rotate

** DONE [7/7] basic control flow templates, based on the basic programs from [[#APTOP]]
*** note: register =Z= contains the address we're writing to as we assemble.
*** DONE 'ok' does nothing, so no bytecode is emitted and it isn't used in the assembler. (' ' works)
*** DONE =.i .. .t .. .e .. .z= provides conditionals
#+name: macros-if
#+begin_src b3a

# if .. then .. else .. end
:i rt
:t lb h0 zw lb 00 zw zd rt
:e .[ hp 00 .] zd sw ov ^z rt
:z du zd sw sb wb rt
#+end_src
**** =.i= is ~[ ( - ) ]~
"If" is pretty much a no-op and only there for human readers.
**** =.t= ("then")  is ~[ ( -z) lb h0 zw lb 00 zw zd ]~
~[ lb h0 zw ]~ emits the opcode for h0
~[ lb 00 zw ]~ emits the byte 0
~[ zd ]~ is the opcode that puts the address in register Z onto the stack

We want to jump if the condition is /false/, but at compile time, we don't know where we're jumping yet, so we need to leave some space for the jump target, and also push the current position onto the stack so we can come back and fill it in later.
**** =.z= ("endif") is ~[ (a- ) du zd sw sb wb ]~
- if the input we're assembling is well formed, address =a= of the hop distance from =th= should still be on the stack. So now:
- =(a- aa)=  du  duplicate a
- =(.. aaz)= zd  take the new address in z
- =(.. aza)= sw  swap them
- =(.. ad)=  sb  subtract to get the distance between =a= and =Z= (and thus how far to jump)
- =(.. )=    wb  writes the distance byte to the address

**** =.e= ("else") is ~[ (a-z) lb hp zw     lb 00 zw   zd sw ov  ^z ex ]~
( a-az)  hp, 0, zd  - unconditional hop to fill in later (jump from end of then to end of else)
(.. zaz) sw ov      -
(.. z)   ^z ex      - we jump to 'el' branch if condition after 'th' is false, which is
                      the same logic as jumping to the end of if..fi so we can just call fi here.
                      the difference is we're keeping another address on the stack for the
                      next =fi= to fill in.

At compile time, it writes the current address to top of ram. (so we can compile the jump later)

#+end_src
=.[= - offset of the .[ in the source is already in y, since we're assembling.
     - no need to preserve y, since we're still reading the same source
     - no need to preserve z, since we're still emitting to the same place

** TODO do a topological sort on the macros to see if we can define them directly on the vm

* -- extra stuff --
** how this exercise affected b4 design
- hex dumper: i probably won't actually use it (since it isn't necessary to GENERATE a hex dump), but i started with this exercise in mind, and once i started writing it in hex+mnemonic assembly style, i was annoyed at how much space i was wasting with packed instructions followed by long addresess. This prompted me to switch to just using a bytecode, and not worry about 32-bit cells.
- hex assembler:  this made me want to do xr as well as yr, to make it easy to compare strings, but i didn't (yet)
- real assembler:
  - i originally thought I'd come up with a bunch of helper functions for managing the dictionary:
    - hash a string
    - compare two strings
    - traverse a linked list
    - or otherwise find a value in a lookup table
  - i went to bed quite frustrated after the inital attempt to approach this, which lead me to start by writing macros / templates for the basic structured programming patterns.
  - at first i was going to use special psuedo-opcodes like =if..th..el..en= but after getting frustrated and going to bed, I had the idea of using a set of lettered registers as the dictionary
  - a forth is two stacks and a dictionary, and the dictionary is the hard part to bootstrap.
  - but a simple 1-char dictionary made everything so much easier:
    - the bytecode never needs to refer to absolute addresses
    - since all hops are short, this means the assembler (basically) only has to deal with 8-bit value
    - so we only need 'rb/wb' instead 'rm/wm' - previously these were not opcodes
  - so all this caused me to add 'rb,wb,bw,go' opcodes

** TODO [2/6] extra control structures
*** TODO =ef= for 'else if' ... maybe this is just =el=, since =if= is a no-op?
*** TODO fn : implementing function arguments
- op 'ac s' would specify up to four arguments
  - s would be a signature byte
    - 2 bits specify number of args (up to 4)
    - 4 bits specify which ones to preserve
    - 2 bits left over for some other purprose
      - ex: you could pass up to 16 arguments, only the last 4 could be writable
      - but you probably just don't need this.
      - you might want 1 bit for 'is recursive'. (see below)
  - inside the definition, allocate n cells
  - push the first n control registers to the return stack
  - (if the function is recursive, you also have to push the cells onto the return stack)
  - set ^A to address of first cell, ^B to next, etc.
  - move the four values from the stack to the cells
  - now inside the function, you can use ^A ^B ^C ^D to refer to the args.
  - before returning, restore the arguments
- all this means more work as part of the protocol, but less stack juggling
*** TODO =rp .. un= : repeat until
*** TODO =case= case / switch statement for scalars
- with or without fallthrough (no fallthrough means you can reorder)
- with range matching
** implementing some ops in b3a
*** DONE implementing =nx= if it weren't an opcode
.[ rd si 01 sb du .]  (leaving two copies of (ii-1))
.[ h0 03 .]           (if 0, hop over the next 3 bytes)
.[ dr hp .] zw        (>0, so put back on return stack and hop backwards)
.[ zp .]              (zap extra 0 at runtime)

*** DONE =.b= ('wb' when I only had 'wm') writes a single byte to an address, while preserving Z
 sw (ab-ba)
 zd (.. baz)
 sw (.. bza)
 dz (.. bz) and Z'=a
 sw (.. zb)
 zw (.. z) and M[a]=b
 dz (.. ) restoring Z
