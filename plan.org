#+title: b4 implementation plan

* -- roadmap --
** DONE get screen io working
** DONE b4s (a tiny lisp-like interface)
** TODO finish memory alloctor
** TODO implement variants

* -- sprint --
** DONE [28/28]
*** DONE fill out constant ops c0 c1 c2 n1 c4
*** DONE use =\d= to change the directory                        :b4i:
*** DONE use =\a= to assemble a file (b4a)                      :b4i:
*** DONE use =\i= to interpret a file (b4i)                      :b4i:
*** DONE flm (fill memory with number)                         :bios:
#+begin_src b4a
  :flm # (ina-) fill n ints with i, starting at address a
    @A dc !A .f          # (ina-i|n)  for a := n downto 0
       du c4 +A wi       # (i|n-i|n) copy i to @A and increment @A
    .n zp cd !A rt       # (i|n-|)  restore old @A and clear stack
#+end_src

*** DONE draw the video buffer                                 :b4ix:

*** DONE =\a= command to assemble a file                         :b4i:

*** DONE bug: =li= loads extra byte
(actualy it could do any number of strange things: the
we needed to add 4 to the ip but only added 3 so the last
byte was treated as an opcode!)

*** DONE bug: =2 3 mlatu= multiplies in b4i
probably just need to check for labels before ops, and
only treat two-character codes as ops

*** DONE implement =@name= and =!name=                             :b4i:
*** DONE implement %R                                          :b4i:
*** DONE get ./test-b4i-pas working
*** DONE fix =sh= with negative TOS                              :ub4:
*** DONE use a line editor with history
*** DONE bug %C does not clear dictionary, causing "too many :defs"
*** DONE [14/14] memory-mapped video terminal                 :term:
**** DONE @tmb : buffer pointer
**** DONE @tmw : width
**** DONE @tmh : height
**** DONE cscr : clear screen
**** DONE @cur : cursor position
**** DONE curx : cursor x
**** DONE cury : cursor y
**** DONE emit : write char to screen buffer
**** DONE goxy : set cursor position
**** DONE sp   : emit space
**** DONE nl   : emit newline
**** DONE maxx : screen width-1
**** DONE maxy : screen height-1
**** DONE puts : write a string
*** DONE bug: \h help text has old ops for :W
*** DONE bug: b4i assembler fails on '#x y'
*** DONE separate bios (term.b4a) from b4f (bios.b4a.org)
- bios has putn, puts, term
- the rest goes into b4f, the forth-like interpreter
*** DONE get putn/base under test
*** DONE \0 command to dump first line of terminal            :b4i:
(I just did this as a word in the bios)
*** DONE implement "raw" and ."counted" strings               :b4a:

*** DONE implement 4ch symbol routines
could use base36 for ~6 chars per symbol, but would only be uppercase, no utf-8.
*** DONE implement nxcl 'allocator'                           :b4s:
*** DONE read lists from input buffer                         :b4s:
*** DONE reader macros for up/dn/qt                           :b4s:
*** DONE generate 16x16 opcode table for the docs             :doc:
*** DONE command to list known labels (=\p=)                    :b4i:
** TODO implement lisp-style 'eval'                            :b4s:
** TODO error code return for assembler                        :b4a:
Currently b4a uses 'hl' (halt) on errors. Consider adding an io op
to return error codes, so assembler can leave error code on stack
and return gracefully for better integration with other tools.
** DONE file I/O operations                                    :io:
Added new 'io' operations for file handling:
- 'd' (delete): (filename-ptr --) deletes file if it exists
- 'x' (exists): (filename-ptr -- bool) returns -1 if file exists, 0 otherwise
- 'z' (size): (filename-ptr -- size|-1) returns file size or -1 if not found
- 'm' (map/load): (dest-addr filename-ptr --) loads file into memory
- 's' (save): (src-addr len filename-ptr --) saves memory region to file

All operations use null-terminated strings in memory for filenames.
Tests in io-tests.org verify all operations work correctly.
Test runner: test-io-pas

* -- inbox --
** TODO would be nice to syntax highlight in b4x input
** TODO bug: if you redefine a label, the old label still gets used.
I think maybe this should be an error, or at least a warning...
** TODO bug: uled sometimes shows stray characters after submit
** TODO =as= op to test assertions?
** TODO have \0 clear the line by default
** TODO pas needs to allow :S midline
** TODO pas needs to allow "string with space"
** TODO allow parens to act as comments
** TODO have .] automatically insert =rt=
** TODO bug: -8 is neither interpreted NOR assembled in pascal
when fixed, update ch< in pre.b4a
** TODO bug: cscr does not clear the background
** TODO bug: can define :| interactively but not assemble it
** TODO assembling ."hello world" gives "unterminated string literal"
** TODO dependencies between tests
It would be kind of cool to document the dependencies between tests,
and use them to generate pert charts, in the following way:

- the b4vm implementation really doesn't need to be 100% complete
until you start needing to actually use the opcodes.

You should be able to implement a spike solution that works at
multiple layers.

You should be able to implement the opcodes in any order you
like, for the most part... But some of them might require other
opcodes (like =ad= needs operands to add, so you need =lb= or =c1=
or similar)

But even as b4 is easy to implement, you shouldn't have to implement
it ALL before moving on to the next thing.

** TODO decide on '@@int' vs '@byte' macro idea.
** TODO scdn : scroll down (?)

** TODO terminal widgets
*** TODO vbuf : create another video buffer
*** TODO cbuf : copy buffer (needs stride)
*** TODO scrw : scroll window (needs stride)
*** TODO line editor
*** TODO list editor

** TODO do allow a forward declaration syntax: =/:=              :b4a:
- when a label is placed, check if it's new and fill in backrefs

** TODO add =$= macro for explicit large hex numbers             :b4a:
** TODO strictly limit features used in the b4a tests          :test:
- b4a is a static assembler + debugger
- should only use step/run, not =^R= or =:R= syntax,
  (because these are b4i features)
- probably do not allow uppercase labels at all
  (at least the first character)
** TODO #!b4 should be standalone executable that runs b4 files
- =x.b4o= :: plain b4 opcodes/hex (no comments, only 2-char whitespace)
- =x.b4a= :: assembly language with comments, labels, macro code
- =x.b4m= :: a saved b4 machine (binary)
- =x.b4d= :: data (binary like k's .l files)

** TODO you should be able to use a machine "statefully" from the command line
- meaning: load a b4m, reads messages from stdin
- then when it's done, save the state back to the b4m
- (should also have option to load and save separately)

** TODO prefix all assembler/debugger commands with =/=
=/s= : step
=/g= : go
=/q= : quit
=/r= : reset stack
=/R= : reset everything

** TODO add breakpoints                                        :b4i:
=/+= addr : breakpoint?
=/-= addr
=/b= : list breakpoints?

** TODO add timer/profiler commands                            :b4i:
=/t= : run with timing (in clock + num ops + num calls)

** TODO trace mode that shows every op?
** TODO idea: assembler command to align to 4byte boundary =:|=  :b4a:
** TODO idea: allocate buffer =:bufname :+HEXNUM=                :b4a:
** TODO macros to write strings
how strings work outside words:
."hello \"cool\" world"

how strings work in words:
:hello  .[ ."hi" .] echo rt

:hello  jm `end :bgn 02 'h 'i :end li `bgn li `echo cl rt


** TODO rn op to push 32 random bits
** TODO ct curent time
** TODO "scaffolding ops" that can be replaced with macros
- c1, c2 etc
** TODO custom assembler macros (uppercase)
** TODO "bicameral" aspect

** WANT port of gestalt/gamesketchlib to b4

I made the java/processing game library at https://github.com/tangentstorm/gamesketchlib
and will try to follow the same design patterns as I work on this system.

godot 4 version: https://github.com/tangentstorm/fnarbmlyx

(there is a javsacript version of this as well but it's currently in a private repo)

** WANT midi/modfile player.

I would really really like a modfile player for retro sounds and music. (don't know what modfiles are? see http://modarchive.org/ )

#+begin_quote me

[13:04] <dom96> I always wanted to compete in Ludum Dare. Sadly, nowadays there isn't enough time.
[13:05] <tangentstorm> http://web.archive.org/web/20080704164939/http://turcanator.tangentcode.com/
[13:05] <tangentstorm> this is a midi sequencer i wrote in pygame... i would love it if someone took that and turned it into the music engine for this system.
[13:06] <tangentstorm> not the graphics part... but the time/synchronization code for the music events
[13:07] <tangentstorm> to make something like this: http://www.photonstorm.com/flod

** IDEA ramdisk / image layout
*** things that need to be in ram somewhere early:
**** the first 256 cells are reserved for registers
**** they also leave room for 256 ngaro-style opcodes
***** (these may be device-specific opcodes, too)
**** first eight bytes should be magic # : utf-16 for the four corners
***** TODO lookup the code points
***** the bios needs to fit in the next 512 bytes
**** map disk pages to ram (probably 4k blocks)
***** maybe give blocks a negative number to indicate system/hardware?
***** this makes sense, as we may have multiple machines in one image
***** btree for where things are laid out in memory
**** maybe a version number / hash for the interpreter config?
**** primary console video ram
**** the basic 256-character font (codepoints + 16 bytes)
**** the registers / stack for each machine
*** paging system
**** ngaro wants ram to be laid out in a specific way
**** the paging system would emulate contiguous ram
**** basically just like the processor does

** IDEA module names (is this still useful?)
*** module io : high level input/output abstraction
**** module io_nw - network
**** module iokb - keyboard
**** module iohd - hard drive
**** module ioss - sound system
**** module iovm - interface to the vm itself
**** module ioip - interprocess communication
*** module vm : the virtual machine
*** module vt : virtual terminal
*** module ui : text widgets
*** module sg : scenegraph
** IDEA posix-friendly "block storage" files
Forth systems tend to use "blocks" instead of "files"
- simplifies editors (no scrolling, just edit screen)

I made a lil/decker tool to browse old block files.
- [ ] find the url?

Idea to make block format that's readable with modern tools:
- force 64-char lines with lf
- extra lf or ---- line every 64 lines
- loader would just ignore those lines
- saver would always add those lines
- use a blkfmt file to enforce/repair the format
** IDEA use `R in b4i while assembling to run a dynamic macro?
- template compilation?
- currently it compiles the address of the register,
  but why do you need that?
