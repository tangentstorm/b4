:END:
We may want the children to be in some particular order, but it doesn't make sense to re-arrange items within the tree to achieve this, because identity is tied to the index, and if you re-ordered a node's children, you'd have to update all the child nodes because the parent's index would have changed.

Instead, keep a separate array that maintains the relative order information, and just add new items as you go along.

* tree rewriting (functional)

:END:
This is really just building a new tree. There's no particular reason to modify the existing tree in place.
