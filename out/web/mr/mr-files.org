The problem with reserving linear chunks to store tables/files/etc:

- if you allocate more space than you need, you're just wasting space.
- if you don't allocate enough space, you have to move the old data.

There are lots of ways to deal with these problems. For many applications, they're not even problems.

In any case, we'll assume our data is stored in linked lists of blocks.
