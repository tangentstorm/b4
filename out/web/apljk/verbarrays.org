Suppose we have an array of dyadic verbs, such as the arithmetic primitives:

#+begin_src j
       ( + , - , * , % )
    + , - , * , %

       5 (+ , - , * , % ) 5
    10 0 25 1
#+end_src

... and we want to convert these to reflexive equivalents:

#+begin_src j
       ( +~ , -~ , *~ , %~ ) 5
    10 0 25 1
#+end_src

It's easy enough to do this by applying the ~ adverb to the entire array:

#+begin_src j
       ( + , - , * , % )~ 5
    10 0 25 1
#+end_src

But what is the general case?
