#+title: b4s: b4vm symbolic scaffolding

* Intro

=b4s= ("beforce") is a tiny lisp-like language written in =b4a= assembly language.

* TODO tanco skips first test
#+name: skip
#+begin_src b4a
(tanco bug makes this skip)
#+end_src

* ensure BIOS is loaded
#+name: b4s.bios
#+begin_src b4a
  > cscr 'o ^O 'k ^O sp B4 putn \0 %q
  ok B4
#+end_src

Assuming the bios is loaded, the above line clears
the internal video screen and prints 'ok B4'.

The `\0` word prints out the first line of video memory.
See [[file:bios-tests.org][bios-tests.org]] for more info.

* nil
#+name: b4s.cells
#+begin_src b4a
  > inic
  > @numc ?d zp
  ds: [3FF]
  > @numc 8 ml @fst^ ad   # nil should be in cell 400
  > @nil^ eq ?d zp
  ds: [-1]
  > @nil^ nil eq ?d zp
  ds: [-1]
  > @nil^ nil? ?d zp
  ds: [-1]
  > %q
#+end_src

Nil is a special cell that marks the end of the list,
and is also used to indcate false.

* car and cdr (nil)
#+name: b4s.nil-parts
#+begin_src b4a
  > inic
  > nil car nil?
  > nil cdr nil?
  > ?d %q
  ds: [-1 -1]
#+end_src

Every cell is a pair of values.

Traditionally, the first of the pair is called the "car"
and the second is called the "cdr" (rhymes with 'footer').

Nil's car and cdr both point back to nil.

* celn
#+name: celn
#+begin_src b4a
  > inic
  > nil celn ?d zp  # nil is -1
  ds: [-1]
  > @fst^ celn ?d zp
  ds: [0]
  > # last (non-nil) cell should have number (numc-1)
  > @end^ 10 sb celn
  > @numc c1 sb eq ?d %q
  ds: [-1]
#+end_src

The function =celn= can be used to map a cell back to its number.
This is only intended for use by these tests, so that we can test
cell adddresses without refering to exact memory locations.

* =inic= and =nxt^= : pointer to next free cell
#+name: b4s.nxt^
#+begin_src b4a
  > inic
  > @nxt^ celn ?d zp   # next cell should be cell 0
  ds: [0]
  > @nxt^ car celn ?d zp
  ds: [1]
  > @nxt^ car car car car celn ?d zp
  ds: [4]
  > # car of last cell in list should be nil
  > @end^ 10 sb car nil? ?d %q
  ds: [-1]
#+end_src

The =inic= routine's last job is to link the allocated
cells together into a list of free cells, storing the
address of the first free cell in @nxtc.

At start, the first free cell should be the first cell,
and its car should point to the next cell (which is the
address 8 bytes ahead).

* =nxtc= : take next cell from free list
#+name: b4s.nxtc
#+begin_src b4a
  > inic
  > # next free should be cell 0
  > @nxt^ celn ?d zp
  ds: [0]
  > # if we take it, then next up is cell 1
  > nxtc celn @nxt^ celn ?d %q
  ds: [0 1]
#+end_src

We can take the next cell from the free list with =nxtc=,
which will put the current value of =nxt^= on the stack, and
cause the =nxt^= to move to the next cell in the list.

* =cons= : construct a cell
#+name: b4s.cons
#+begin_src b4a
  > inic
  > ABCD 1234 cons !C
  > # 1. it allocates a new cell
  > @C celn ?d zp
  ds: [0]
  > # 2. it sets cdr to TOS
  > @C cdr ?d zp
  ds: [1234]
  > # 3. it sets car to NOS
  > @C car ?d zp %q
  ds: [ABCD]
#+end_src

* =cnum= / =pnum= : construct and print a lisp number
#+name: b4s.nums
#+begin_src b4a
  > inic
  > 7C cnum du pnum \0 cscr
  7C
  > celn ?d %q
  ds: [0]
#+end_src

We have to wrap plain b4 numbers in cells in order to use them in b4s.

=cnum= encloses a plain b4 number in a cell.

=pnum= prints the numeric cell (depends on =putn= from the bios).

* =glu= and =o4c= : symbol helpers
#+name: b4s.sym-helpers
#+begin_src b4a
  > 's 'y 'm '! ?d        # four ascii characters
  ds: [73 79 6D 21]
  > glu ?d                # glue together as symbol
  ds: [216D7973]
  > o4c ?d \0 %q          # o4c calls ^O on each non-zero char
  ds: []
  sym!
#+end_src

For now, symbols are limited to 4 ascii characters, which are packed
together into a standard int32.

* =csym= / =psym= : construct and print symbols
#+name: b4s.syms
#+begin_src b4a
  > inic
  > 't 'a 'c 'o ?d
  ds: [74 61 63 6F]
  > glu csym du psym \0 cdr ?d
  ds: [6F636174]
  taco
#+end_src

Symbols are stored in the cdr of a cell, just like a b4s number.

* =ctyp= : distinguish cell types
#+name: b4s.ctyp
#+begin_src b4a
  > inic
  > # by default, cells are type 0b000=0 (lists)
  > nxtc ctyp ?d zp
  ds: [0]
  > # numbers are type 0b010=2
  > 12345 cnum ctyp ?d zp
  ds: [2]
  > # symbols are type 0b100=4
  > 's 'i 'm 'i glu csym ctyp ?d zp %q
  ds: [4]
#+end_src

So far, symbols and numbers are both cells with =nil=
in the car and a 32-bit value in the cdr. Since we created the
cells ourselves, we know what's in them, and can call the
correct print routine manually.

But when we're dealing with dynamic data, we need some way to
tell them apart.

Since we know that cells are aligned to an 8-byte address (meaning
a cell address always ends in =0= or =8=), we can use the lower three
bits to store extra data.

We will use the lowest bit in a mark-and-sweep garbage collector later.
Meanwhile, the next two bits are a type code.

The =ctyp= word returns this code.

(The final bit pattern 0b110=6 is reserved for future use. It will
indicate a pointer to a non-b4s value for interop with other languages
running on the vm.)

Note that once you implement =ctyp=, you will probably need to mask out
the type code in the implementation of =car= and =cdr=.

* =pval= : print arbitrary cells

** printing numbers and symbols
#+name: b4s.pval-num-sym
#+begin_src b4a
  > inic
  > 's 'y 'm 00 glu csym pval \0 cscr
  sym
  > 's 'y 'm 00 glu cnum pval \0 %q
  6D7973
#+end_src

Now that we have =ctyp= we can start to implement pval.
It should inspect the type code and then call =pnum= or =psym= accordingly.

** printing nil
#+name: b4s.pval-nil
#+begin_src b4a
  > inic
  > nil pval \0 %q
  ()
#+end_src

=nil= is a special value and should have type code 00, since it's the name for the empty list.
However, if we print it on its own, we should print the value '()'

** printing a dotted pair
#+name: b4s.pval-pair
#+begin_src b4a
  > inic
  > c1 cnum c2 cnum cons pval \0 %q
  (1 . 2)
#+end_src

** printing lists
#+name: b4s.pval-list
#+begin_src b4a
  > inic
  > 03 cnum nil cons du pval \0 cscr
  (3)
  > 02 cnum sw cons du pval \0 cscr
  (2 3)
  > 01 cnum sw cons du pval \0 cscr
  (1 2 3)
  > 04 cnum nil cons cons pval \0 %q
  ((1 2 3) 4)
#+end_src
