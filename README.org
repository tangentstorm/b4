#+title: The b4 virtual machine

* About

*b4* is a tiny virtual machine, with a forth-like flavor.

There are currently five implementations:

- [[./jlang/]], implemented in [[https://code.jsoftware.com/wiki/Main_Page][J]].
- [[./pas/]], implemented in [[https://www.freepascal.org/][free pascal]].
- [[./lil/]], implemented in [[https://beyondloom.com/decker/lil.html][lil]].
- [[./js/]], implemented in javascript.
- [[https://github.com/tangentstorm/b4-gd][b4-gd]], implemented in GDScript for [[https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/][Godot 4]].

The implementations are kept in sync
through the tests in [[./b4-tests.org]]

See [[bios/bios.b4a]] for an example of b4 assembly language.

* Background

B4 is a forth-like language. Quick *intros to forth* (free and online):

 - [[http://www.forth.com/starting-forth/][Starting Forth]]

B4 was strongly influenced by the [[http://retroforth.org/docs/The_Ngaro_Virtual_Machine.html][ngaro virtual machine]] from retroforth 11,
as well as the [[https://www.greenarraychips.com/home/documents/index.php#architecture][forth chips from greenarrays]].
