#+title: The b4 virtual machine

* About

*b4* is a tiny virtual machine, with a forth-like flavor.

It currently has two (slightly out of sync) implementations:

- [[b4.ijs]] is an implementation in [[https://code.jsoftware.com/wiki/Main_Page][J]].
- [[pas/]] contains an implementation in [[https://www.freepascal.org/][free pascal]].

See [[pas/bios.b4a]] for an example of b4 assembly language.

* Background

B4 is a forth-like language. Quick *intros to forth* (free and online):

 - [[http://www.forth.com/starting-forth/][Starting Forth]]

B4 was strongly influenced by the [[http://retroforth.org/docs/The_Ngaro_Virtual_Machine.html][ngaro virtual machine]] from retroforth 11,
as well as the [[https://www.greenarraychips.com/home/documents/index.php#architecture][forth chips from greenarrays]].
